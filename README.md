Crystals Collector Game

The objective of the game is to match the random number displayed on screen using the crystals.

Each crystal has a unique hidden value that you can only find out by clicking on it.

If you match the number with your score, you win.

If you go over, you lose.

After you either win or lose, the game will reset with a new number to match and each crystal will have a new hidden value.

The wins and losses will keep updating, so do not refresh the page!

Try to get 10 wins in a row. Good luck!
